 * BlueDevil::asyncCall(device, SLOT(registerDevice()));
 * @endcode
 *

 * @class Device bluedevildevice.h bluedevil/bluedevildevice.h
 *
 * This class represents a remote device, discovered by an Adapter.
 *
 * This device has some information for free (this meaning there is no need to register the device
 * on the bus). This properties that do not need connection are explicitly marked on their
 * respective documentation.
 *
 * Since this values are cached, you will not get updates on their state until you make a call that
 * forces the device to be registered on the bus (and thus, created, in D-Bus terminology), or you
 * explicitly call to registerDevice.
 *
 * After the Device has been registered, it will automatically update its properties internally, and
 * additionally signals like pairedChanged will be emitted when this properties are updated.
 *
 * Please note that since some functions here are blocking, there exists a way to asynchronous
 * perform certain operations that are known to be expensive. This way your GUI will not block
 * itself when waiting for a response from the remote device.
